// caprock-pty-host holds one owned session's terminal so it outlives the
// daemon (ADR-033). It is `caprock pty-host` built on its own: the daemon
// starts it when it sits beside the caprock binary, and `caprock pty-host`
// otherwise. Started by the daemon, never by a person.
//
// It exists for memory. A process pays for every package the binary links
// before main runs, and the caprock binary links the whole daemon: the SQLite
// driver's libc alone parses /etc/services into tables in every process it
// starts. One holder runs per terminal, so that start-up cost was paid once
// per shell and session. This binary links only the holder (ADR-033 has the
// numbers).
